**Namaste javaScript**
**What is JavaScript? How javaScript works and is the javaScript is signle threaded and multi threaded and what is exicution context?
- So JavaScript is a synchronous signle-threaded language.
- This whole thing which you can se in the exicution context.the first component also know as the memory component.
  The second component is known as the code component. memory component contains variable and functions as the key and value pairs.
  and the code component is the place where the whole js code is exicuted. memory component
  is also known as the variable enviroment and the code component is also known as the thread of exicution.
- So this thread of exicution is like a thread in which the whole code is exicution one line at a time.

**code exicution in javaScript 
    console.log("hello")
    console.log("x", x)
    var x = 10;

    function getName() {
        var b = 5;
        console.log("hii my name is ritik")
    }

    function getRitilk() {
        console.log("hii ritik ")
    }
    getName()
    console.log(getName)
    console.log("x1", x)
Answer:- JavaScript me execution do phases me hota hai: memory creation (hoisting) aur code execution. 
        var undefined hota hai aur functions fully hoist ho jaate hain
    -Phase 1: Memory Creation (Hoisting)
        -JavaScript sabse pehle memory allocate karta hai:
        x        → undefined
        getName  → function reference
        getRitilk→ function reference

        console:-
        var → undefined
        function → fully hoisted

    Phase 2: Code Execution (Line by Line)
        js:- console.log("hello")
        output:- hello
        js:- console.log("x", x) //x abhi assign nahi hua → undefined
        output:- x undefined
        js:- var x = 10; //Ab x = 10
        js:-function getName() {
                var b = 5;
                console.log("hii my name is ritik")
            } 
            function getRitilk() {
                console.log("hii ritik ")
            }
            Same (hoisted)
            Already memory me tha (no change)
        js:- getName() //Function call → console:
        output:- hii my name is ritik

        js:-console.log(getName) //Function ka definition print hoga
        output:- ƒ getName() { ... }

        js:- console.log("x1", x) //x ki value ab 10 hai
        output:- x1 10

        Final Output Order:-
            hello
            x undefined
            hii my name is ritik
            ƒ getName() { ... }
            x1 10
